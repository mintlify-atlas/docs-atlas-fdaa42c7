## Why NativePHP Desktop?

NativePHP Desktop bridges the gap between web development and native desktop applications. Instead of learning entirely new technologies, you can leverage your existing Laravel and PHP knowledge to create powerful desktop applications.

### Key Features

- **Full Laravel Integration** - Use all Laravel features including Eloquent, queues, events, and more
- **Cross-Platform** - Build once, deploy to Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Native APIs** - Access operating system features through simple, elegant facades
- **Development Mode** - Test and debug your application locally before building
- **Production Ready** - Bundle your application into distributable installers

## How It Works

NativePHP Desktop uses Electron under the hood to provide a native shell for your Laravel application. Your PHP code runs on an embedded PHP server, while the UI is rendered using web technologies. This architecture gives you:
