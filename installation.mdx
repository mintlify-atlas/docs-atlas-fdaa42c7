# Installation

Get NativePHP Desktop up and running in your Laravel application in just a few steps.

## Prerequisites

Before installing NativePHP Desktop, ensure you have:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="PHP 8.3+" icon="php">
    NativePHP requires PHP version 8.3 or higher
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Laravel 10+" icon="laravel">
    Compatible with Laravel 10.x, 11.x, and 12.x
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Composer" icon="box">
    For managing PHP dependencies
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="ext-zip" icon="file-zipper">
    PHP zip extension must be enabled
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Package Conflicts**: NativePHP Desktop cannot be installed alongside `nativephp/mobile`, `nativephp/laravel`, or `nativephp/electron`. Only one NativePHP package should be used per project.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Install via Composer

Install the NativePHP Desktop package using Composer:

```bash
composer require nativephp/desktop
```

This will install:

- The `nativephp/desktop` package
- Required dependencies including `nativephp/php-bin` for embedded PHP runtime
- Laravel package tools and utilities

<Note>
  The installation may take a few moments as it downloads the embedded PHP binaries for desktop distribution.
</Note>

## Step 2: Publish Configuration

Publish the NativePHP configuration file and service provider:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Native\Desktop\NativeServiceProvider"
```

This creates:

- `config/nativephp.php` - Main configuration file
- `app/Providers/NativeAppServiceProvider.php` - Your application's native service provider

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configuration File">
    The `config/nativephp.php` file contains settings for your application metadata, updater configuration, and build options.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Service Provider">
    The `NativeAppServiceProvider` is where you'll bootstrap your application, configure windows, menus, and handle application lifecycle events.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Verify Installation

Verify that NativePHP Desktop is correctly installed by checking the available Artisan commands:

```bash
php artisan list native
```

You should see several `native:*` commands available:

```
Available commands:
  native:debug    Debug NativePHP application
  native:fresh    Drop all tables and re-run migrations
  native:migrate  Run database migrations
  native:seed     Seed the database
  native:wipe     Wipe the NativePHP database
```

## Package Overview

### Automatic Registration

NativePHP Desktop automatically registers these facades for use in your application:

<CodeGroup>
```php Native\Desktop\Facades\Window
use Native\Desktop\Facades\Window;

// Open a new window
Window::open()
    ->title('My App')
    ->width(800)
    ->height(600);
```

```php Native\Desktop\Facades\Notification
use Native\Desktop\Facades\Notification;

// Show a native notification
Notification::new()
    ->title('Welcome!')
    ->message('Your app is ready')
    ->show();
```

```php Native\Desktop\Facades\Menu
use Native\Desktop\Facades\Menu;

// Create application menus
Menu::new()
    ->label('File')
    ->items([
        MenuItem::new('New', 'file.new'),
        MenuItem::new('Open', 'file.open'),
    ]);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Available Facades

NativePHP provides the following facades out of the box:

- `ChildProcess` - Spawn and manage child processes
- `Clipboard` - Access system clipboard
- `ContextMenu` - Create context menus
- `Dock` - Control macOS dock (macOS only)
- `GlobalShortcut` - Register global keyboard shortcuts
- `Menu` - Create application menus
- `MenuBar` - Create menu bar applications
- `Notification` - Show native notifications
- `PowerMonitor` - Monitor system power events
- `Process` - Manage application processes
- `QueueWorker` - Background queue workers
- `Screen` - Get display information
- `Settings` - Persistent application settings
- `Shell` - Execute shell commands
- `System` - Access system information
- `Window` - Manage application windows
- `Updater` - Handle application updates

## Development vs Production

NativePHP Desktop works differently in development and production:

### Development Mode

In development (`APP_DEBUG=true`), NativePHP:

- Uses your local PHP installation
- Creates a SQLite database at `database/nativephp.sqlite`
- Automatically runs migrations
- Shows developer tools in windows
- Provides detailed error messages

### Production Mode

In production (after building), NativePHP:

- Bundles an embedded PHP runtime
- Uses an isolated storage directory
- Hides developer tools
- Cleans up sensitive environment variables
- Optimizes for performance

<Note>
  You can develop and test your application locally before building it for distribution. See the [Quick Start](/quickstart) guide to run your first desktop app.
</Note>

## Next Steps

Now that NativePHP Desktop is installed:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Configuration" icon="gear" href="/configuration">
    Configure your application settings and metadata
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Quick Start" icon="rocket" href="/quickstart">
    Build your first desktop application
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### ext-zip Not Installed

If you get an error about the `ext-zip` extension:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install php-zip

# macOS (via Homebrew)
pecl install zip

# Windows
# Enable extension=zip in php.ini
```

### Composer Memory Issues

If Composer runs out of memory during installation:

```bash
php -d memory_limit=-1 $(which composer) require nativephp/desktop
```

### Package Conflicts

If you have other NativePHP packages installed:

```bash
# Remove conflicting packages first
composer remove nativephp/mobile nativephp/laravel nativephp/electron

# Then install NativePHP Desktop
composer require nativephp/desktop
```
